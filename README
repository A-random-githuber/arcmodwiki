## Arcaea Modding Wiki
A work-in-progress centralized wiki for everything Arcaea modding related.

### Contributing
The entire wiki is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast static site generator, and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

You will need to have Python 3 installed.

Install all required dependencies by running the following command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements
```

After that, make any changes you want to make! All wiki pages are entirely made of Markdown, which is very beginner-friendly. When adding a new page, make sure to update `mkdocs.yml` too.

You can test your changes by running `mkdocs serve` on your computer which will host a local instance of the wiki directly on your computer. It will also auto refresh when changes are detected.

Once you have done what you need to, feel free to [send a Pull Request!](https://github.com/FishiaT/arcmodwiki/compare)
