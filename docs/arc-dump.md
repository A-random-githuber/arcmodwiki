    This page is being actively worked on. Contributions of any kind are much appreciated.

Before proceeding with modding Arcaea, its APK/IPA file must be dumped from your device. Depending on your operating system, dumping procedure will be different.

## iOS

!!! warning "Before starting"
    Either [TrollStore](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/) or a [jailbroken](https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started) device is **required**. As a result, you will not be able to perform anything listed in here if you are using any devices that were updated to iOS 16.6.1 or newer and is not checkm8-vulnerable.

Before proceeding, make sure you have Arcaea installed and have opened at least once.

### Using TrollDecrypt

!!! tip "Info"
    The recommended method. Works for all versions that are supported by TrollStore.

Install [TrollDecrypt](https://github.com/donato-fiore/TrollDecrypt/releases/) onto your device using TrollStore, then open it. All apps that can be decrypted will be listed, select Arcaea and choose **Yes** when prompted. The decryption process will take a while. When it finishes, the resulting IPA will be available form within the app, copy it to your PC and you are done!

### Using DumpDecrypter

!!! tip "Info"
    An alternative to TrollDecrypt for devices that is not supported by TrollStore. **May not work with rootless jailbreaks (e.g. Dopamine, palera1n)**.

Open Sileo or any package managers that you like, add this repository: `https://repo.tuandb.name.vn`. After that, install **DumpDecrypter** from it.

Open **DumpDecrypter**, switch to the **Settings** tab and enable all available options. Then return to the **AppList** tab and select Arcaea, press **Continue** when prompted and wait for the decryption process to complete. Arcaea will automatically open and then close shortly after. When it finishes, press **Go to Filza to view** (Filza must be installed from the BigBoss repository beforehand) then copy the resulting IPA to your PC and you are done!
